This is a test page.

## Link

- [test](articles/test.md)

![](assets/test-svgrepo-com.svg "サンプル")

## Idea

We can use `markdown-to-html` with the additional script that does the following:
- Rewrite the anchor tags pointing to `README.md` to `index.html`
- Rewrite the anchor tags pointing to `.md` file to `.html`
